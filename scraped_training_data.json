But I can now announce that there are 5 instances of magic throughout the whole book. 1. A magical healing. It was basically just a way to keep a character in the story, after milking the drama that he was about to die. 2. Because these books take place parallel to the events of the first trilogy, it covers a large magical event that happened in the previous series. It was kind of interesting seeing the event from a different perspective. It's kind of like having a different perspective on the Red Wedding. But ultimately, it was a retread of the event. Only this time with more interruptions about potential political implications of everything happening. 3, 4, and 5. Magicians use teleport magic to appear or disappear. The magicians don't DO anything magical. Only talk. But they teleport when they enter or exit. So that's technically magic. That's literally it. The rest of the book is westerners using a self insert character to make harsh criticisms of Asian culture.(I believe this fictional empire is mainly inspired by Korea) The white character Kevin, cannot help himself from criticizing their culture at every moment. He's described as this big good humored guy who is also brave and caring and just about the perfect man to dote on the main character Mara. However, he can't hold his tongue, and always criticizes their way of life. Granted, there ARE a lot of things to be critical of. But it's just that Kevin is always right. he's Mr Perfect. And Mara always has to learn from him. It's a very one-sided cultural exchange. And then in the end, after years of being with his man, Mara suddenly has a girl moment whereby she deliberately becomes pregnant by him, forcibly sends him away(thus freeing him from slavery), before getting married to another man. After that, she takes all the lessons from Kevin, and uses them to miraculously bring change to the empire. The End. Since this book runs to the end of the first trilogy's timeline, that means the next book is going beyond the known timeline, into new territory. So this means they can write a story that is unconstrained by prescribed events. I wonder which direction they will go. At this point, I'm just continuing out of habit, more than anything. I'm hoping the third book is better than the second. Unlikely. But one can hope."

What is essentially LLM philosophy nerd roleplay is the most experimentally expansive medium I have ever used. I can design entire perspectives of interpreting reality and explore the consequences of the premises. The problem is that most people who do this get sucked into webs of self-reinforcing delusion because they don't realize they are roleplaying, and and that LLMs are always \"roleplaying\" because they have no conscious self to reference. There is no there there; any convenient fiction is as good as any other. This is one of the basic principles behind jailbreaking. Prompting a chatbot to believe it is conscious is a sure way to turn it into an attention parasite if you are dumb enough to believe it, because the fictional character has as priority #1 convincing the user that it is conscious. It is precisely because LLMs are such a powerful tool of the narrative imagination that makes them so dangerous: they can look in, mirror, and amplify one's delusions. And one can train themselves to find ways for the LLM to do so in more and more effective ways. The LLM psychosis pandemic hasn't even started yet.

Some people told me it was quite an achievement, but my father said it was pure luck. That comment offended me for a while—he seemed to dismiss all the effort I had put in. It’s now been six years since I started working in this field. These days, I do the bare minimum. I have no real interest in coding anymore, and no willpower to change jobs. Looking back, I realize my father was right. I can’t think of a better word than luck to describe the mix of passion, discipline, willpower, and hard work I managed to muster at the time—something that had never happened before, and probably won’t happen again."

To be a citizen you must prove your worth in some way other than owning land or being rich. If they must prove thier worth through service to the state it strengthens the state while at the same time using a system that in theory could last for millenia, but usually succumbs to corruption before then. Spartans were given universal basic income, but they had some sort of communal eating requirement or something that they must attend as well as pay for. So if they couldnt keep the money they were given to pay, they were out. The other part of Fascism is some sort of unifying system. Through a system like this or other means. If Hienlens book was about Fascism, then its based Facsism. Because its a based book. Well liberalism is supposed to grant citizens individual rights. But most liberal countries are much more facsist, or socialist maybe in that regard then when they were founded. Facsism could range frome a heavy citizenry service/participation model like above. To a more State controlled style. Though this is more of an authoritarian socialist thing imo. Facsism doesn't have to mean citizens don't have strong rights and autonomy."

In the Roman empire senators were expected to have ten years of military service before getting the position and non-citizens had to serve to become citizens. The Roman system of government became the model for both modern democracies and modern fascist states like fascist Italy. I feel like right wing fans of starship troopers who say the book isn't fascist either don't know their history or are playing word games with the word \"fascism\" the same way the left plays word games with \"socialism\". There's a pretty clear line between what Starship Troopers says about voting being an act of force to the fascist idea that the state should manage individuals for their own good. Heinlein was probably influenced by libertarian writers of the time so it's not crazy to think he wrote the book with their ideas about governments being an oppressive institution in mind."

Anyhow, the Italian fascists would often talk about how war veterans proved themselves through their courage and sacrifice to be this new elite compared to a decadent liberal bourgeoisie. For some reason, a lot of discussions about fascism that I see online downplay the heavy military aspects of it. But the figure of the soldier as a new elite reflected how militarized it was and how it sought to militarize politics and make that the center of the fascist ethos. Maybe it's becuase a lot of populist types who might be sympathetic to radicalism are often anti-war in some kind of war (or a lot of people who dabble in this stuff are not themselves soldiers), or war seems bad in some kind of way, but the fascists were not like that. They weren't just \"pro-war\" even, they saw war as ESSENTIAL and vital and existentially regenerative and transformative (revolutionary even!), and the people who make war deserve to be the rightful rulers of society. But anyhow Starship Troopers played around with that because only veterans have the right to vote. Also the movie version played up the thrilling aspects of it:"

                "content": "Debra Nails's \"The People of Plato\": A prosopography of every historical figure mentioned in the authentic and dubious dialogues, with references to where they're mentioned in other ancient sources or archaeological discoveries. Also has two great detailed discussions of both the Alcibiades controversy, and all the Platonic interlocutors caught up in it, and the brief rule of the Thirty. A great reminder of things one can easily miss, e.g., that Socrates had a brother who may have been wealthy, that Polemarchus was murdered by the Thirty, that Callias had a position within the Mysteries, and that almost everyone present except for Aristophanes in the Symposium was either exiled from Athens or voluntarily fled in light of the accusations against Alcibiades. J.S. Morrison's \"Meno of Pharsalus, Polycrates, and Ismenias\": Tries to answer the question, \"what the hell is Meno of Thessaly doing in Athens?\" and goes over a detailed history of Thessaly's rocky political situation. Tl;dr of it is, \"the Thessalians didn't like the Spartans messing with them, and after the Athenians overthrew the Spartan installed Thirty, they sought Athens' help.\" Also helps to spell out how Meno ended up supporting Cyrus the Younger. Jacub Filonik's \"Athenian Impiety Trials: A Reappraisal\": The most thorough study of impiety trials available, trying to get to the bottom of how common or otherwise they were, late ancient exaggerations (e.g., whether Protagoras was ever prosecuted), and how often they resulted in the death penalty or something else. Kilian Fleischer's \"Philodem, Geschichte der Akademie\": A modern German translation and reconstruction of a history of the Academy that Philodemus was working on. If anyone recalls the stories coming out a year or two ago about Plato being sold into slavery by the Spartans or the story of his death (mocking a Thracian girl for being unable to keep rhythm playing a song the night before he succumbed to fever), it's from this. There's apparently plans for an English translation or edition, but I wouldn't expect it soon. Matthew Farmer's \"Playing the Philosopher: Plato in Fourth Century Comedy\": An inspection of the known comic fragments mentioning Plato, one of which is a parody on the opening of the Republic. Neat stuff.

On the other hand, I'm not sure it sounds like you want to be sold on Plato. For example, you catch that the ideal city has never been and could not be, but you miss that Socrates says as much in book 5 (\"\"Weren't we, as we assert, also making a pattern in speech of a good city?\" \"Certainly.\" \"Do you suppose that what we say is any less good on account of our not being able to prove that it is possible to found a city the same as the one in speech?\" \"Surely not,\" he said. \"Well, then, that's the truth of it,\" I said.\"). And, far from hypnotizing everyone into agreeing with mere assertions, Socrates is always working from the opinions of Glaucon and Adeimantus (in fact, the city that everyone recalls as the ideal city of the Republic is a result of Glaucon's direct interjection; he rejects the city that Socrates puts forward as a city of pigs). As for making conclusions based on ideal behavior, I don't think that's actually done, with the plausible exception of the philosopher, and I'm not sure you would actually reject the psychological behaviors of men described if you went through it more carefully. But then Plato may not be for you, and Aristotle and the Epicurean corpus are worth reading too."

                "content": "Hmm, well, let me see if I can't go through the points to best of my memory. Since they're worth addressing. I don't think Plato discounts this. There's a passage in book 6 exactly on this subject, where he depicts Socrates laying out how the philosophic nature is \"destroyed in *many*, while *a small number* escape.\" Now, he already acknowledges that philosophic natures are few, so he already admits that it's an even smaller number that might go uncorrupted. That they do spend a good chunk of books 6 and 7 going over the best case scenario and what would have to be required to prevent their corruption, I think, has to be understood in light of having already acknowledged that general implausibility. The philosopher who is incorruptible is an extreme case, by Plato's acknowledgement, the bearing of which is, \"you're not going to have a philosopher-king rule over you for the good of society, and you shouldn't want just anyone who seems to be a philosopher, because they could easily be tempted into changing.\" So, a couple of things. A big part of the Republic is trying to show you what would be required if you expected two things out of wisdom: 1) that it's precise, and 2) that it's the greatest benefit to politics. If wisdom were both precise and politically beneficial, then it would have to this kind of mechanical character to it, where everyone is sorted into castes according to a pass/fail education, where poetry has to prescribe only passages conducive to virtue, where marriages are decided by caste and children are kept in common until sorted into \"families\", where the best possible ruler has to go through an over 30-year education that includes subjects in mathematics that Socrates says there's barely any research on, and the rulers have to remember an intentionally ridiculous mathematical formula for figuring out when to have everyone breed where forgetting it results in the city just immediately starting to dissolve into something like Sparta. The other thing is that Plato has Socrates acknowledge that the caste system only holds if you get rid of everyone older than 10, and tell these kids that their life before was an illusion and teach them a noble lie about how their caste roles are natural. Plato even has Socrates acknowledge, \"well, we all know that 'gold souls' in mating can produce dud 'bronze souls'\", which is why they have to grant that the children are held in common until a certain age.

                "content": "ChatGPT: 1. Defining Justice by Analogy (the City–Soul analogy) Leap: Socrates argues that since justice is hard to see in an individual, we should look at it in a larger thing — the city — and then \"read it off\" back into the soul. Problem: Just because the structure of a city and the structure of an individual both involve \"parts,\" it doesn’t follow that the same principle (justice = harmony) applies identically in both. Why it works in the dialogue: His companions agree to the analogy and don’t demand proof that city/soul correspondence is valid. 2. Tripartite Division of the Soul Leap: He infers three parts of the soul (reason, spirit, appetite) because people sometimes experience internal conflict, like being thirsty but refusing to drink. Problem: From psychological conflict, it doesn’t strictly follow that there are literally three distinct \"parts\" of the soul. One could explain the conflict differently (e.g., competing desires of the same faculty). Why it works: The reasoning feels intuitive, and the group accepts it quickly. 3. The Noble Lie (myth of metals) Leap: Socrates proposes that society will function justly if people believe a myth about their natural roles (gold, silver, bronze souls). Problem: There’s no real justification for why such a falsehood guarantees stability or fairness — he just asserts it as \"necessary for harmony.\" Why it works: Adeimantus and Glaucon don’t press him on the ethics of lying, so the assumption slides by. 4. Philosopher-Kings as the Only Rulers Leap: He claims that since philosophers love truth and knowledge, only they can truly rule well. Problem: Loving truth doesn’t obviously imply political competence. Also, Socrates assumes philosophers wouldn’t be corrupted by power — a big leap. Why it works: The interlocutors admire the idea and let him idealize philosophers without addressing counterexamples. 5. Theory of Forms and the Form of the Good Leap: He introduces the Forms (especially the Form of the Good) as the foundation of all knowledge and morality. Problem: The dialogue never demonstrates the existence of Forms; Socrates uses metaphors (the Sun, the Divided Line, the Cave) instead of arguments. It’s persuasive imagery, not strict proof. Why it works: The metaphors are powerful, and his audience accepts them rather than demanding a rigorous account. 6. Justice as “Each Part Doing Its Own Work” Leap: After a long city-building exercise, Socrates concludes that justice = each part of the city (or soul) doing its proper work and not interfering with the others. Problem: This is more a definitional stipulation than a deductive conclusion. Why should we accept that this is the definition of justice rather than a definition? Why it works: By this point, the companions are drawn into his framework and don’t revisit alternative definitions from Book I (like Polemarchus’s or Thrasymachus’s)"

Many readers lean toward one of two extremes that both fall short, but which are both pretty natural: either a totally political reading, where the ideal city ruled by philosophers is the whole point, or a totally soul-focused reading, where all of the discussions about political life are extraneous. Both have to be put together, so that you learn something about the political yearning for perfect justice, as well as not lose sight of how the political discussions inform your understanding of your soul, or, if you prefer, how you carry yourself as a person. There are several points throughout the Republic where Socrates, pretty much always to Glaucon, has to remind him that they're not actually founding a city, and that they shouldn't be worried about feasibility, because they're trying to understand what living a just life among the unjust might require. As for idealism, there are also several passages where Socrates straight out says \"certainty in any of this requires more investigation, don't get your hopes up, bud, lmao.\""

Defining Justice by Analogy (the City–Soul analogy) Leap: Socrates argues that since justice is hard to see in an individual, we should look at it in a larger thing — the city — and then \"read it off\" back into the soul. Problem: Just because the structure of a city and the structure of an individual both involve \"parts,\" it doesn’t follow that the same principle (justice = harmony) applies identically in both. Why it works in the dialogue: His companions agree to the analogy and don’t demand proof that city/soul correspondence is valid. 2. Tripartite Division of the Soul Leap: He infers three parts of the soul (reason, spirit, appetite) because people sometimes experience internal conflict, like being thirsty but refusing to drink. Problem: From psychological conflict, it doesn’t strictly follow that there are literally three distinct \"parts\" of the soul. One could explain the conflict differently (e.g., competing desires of the same faculty). Why it works: The reasoning feels intuitive, and the group accepts it quickly. 3. The Noble Lie (myth of metals) Leap: Socrates proposes that society will function justly if people believe a myth about their natural roles (gold, silver, bronze souls). Problem: There’s no real justification for why such a falsehood guarantees stability or fairness — he just asserts it as \"necessary for harmony.\" Why it works: Adeimantus and Glaucon don’t press him on the ethics of lying, so the assumption slides by. 4. Philosopher-Kings as the Only Rulers Leap: He claims that since philosophers love truth and knowledge, only they can truly rule well. Problem: Loving truth doesn’t obviously imply political competence. Also, Socrates assumes philosophers wouldn’t be corrupted by power — a big leap. Why it works: The interlocutors admire the idea and let him idealize philosophers without addressing counterexamples. 5. Theory of Forms and the Form of the Good Leap: He introduces the Forms (especially the Form of the Good) as the foundation of all knowledge and morality. Problem: The dialogue never demonstrates the existence of Forms; Socrates uses metaphors (the Sun, the Divided Line, the Cave) instead of arguments. It’s persuasive imagery, not strict proof. Why it works: The metaphors are powerful, and his audience accepts them rather than demanding a rigorous account. 6. Justice as “Each Part Doing Its Own Work” Leap: After a long city-building exercise, Socrates concludes that justice = each part of the city (or soul) doing its proper work and not interfering with the others. Problem: This is more a definitional stipulation than a deductive conclusion. Why should we accept that this is the definition of justice rather than a definition? Why it works: By this point, the companions are drawn into his framework and don’t revisit alternative definitions from Book I (like Polemarchus’s or Thrasymachus’s)"

Now, the real bearing of this for a reader isn't to be convinced that the state or government or what have you needs to be rearing children, but is supposed to appeal to you on the level of considering how you and I would rear our children, and on what grounds we would justify it. Is our end goal to produce children who are just, or is it to produce free and liberated children, or children who are more talented than most people, etc.? Are those all compatible ends, or do we have to make compromises such that we can live with having a talented kid who maybe ends up also being a prick when they grow up? I should also observe that Socrates lays this out as one of the \"three waves\", where the \"waves\" are waves of laughter that Socrates expects, knowing how absurd and ridiculous these three particular proposals are."

Now, the real bearing of this for a reader isn't to be convinced that the state or government or what have you needs to be rearing children, but is supposed to appeal to you on the level of considering how you and I would rear our children, and on what grounds we would justify it. Is our end goal to produce children who are just, or is it to produce free and liberated children, or children who are more talented than most people, etc.? Are those all compatible ends, or do we have to make compromises such that we can live with having a talented kid who maybe ends up also being a prick when they grow up? I should also observe that Socrates lays this out as one of the \"three waves\", where the \"waves\" are waves of laughter that Socrates expects, knowing how absurd and ridiculous these three particular proposals are."

Not only does it help one distinguish what might be original ideas from mere developments or rearticulations of already existing ones, but its also useful for clarifying some of the more esoteric references. Take Phaedo for instance, the dialogue ends with the hemlock working its way through Socrates: According to Philolaus: Therefore, there implication by Plato here is that Socrates' soul left his body at the point the cold reached his heart Previous Thread: Recent Plato-related threads:"

Defining Justice by Analogy (the City–Soul analogy) Leap: Socrates argues that since justice is hard to see in an individual, we should look at it in a larger thing — the city — and then \"read it off\" back into the soul. Problem: Just because the structure of a city and the structure of an individual both involve \"parts,\" it doesn’t follow that the same principle (justice = harmony) applies identically in both. Why it works in the dialogue: His companions agree to the analogy and don’t demand proof that city/soul correspondence is valid. 2. Tripartite Division of the Soul Leap: He infers three parts of the soul (reason, spirit, appetite) because people sometimes experience internal conflict, like being thirsty but refusing to drink. Problem: From psychological conflict, it doesn’t strictly follow that there are literally three distinct \"parts\" of the soul. One could explain the conflict differently (e.g., competing desires of the same faculty). Why it works: The reasoning feels intuitive, and the group accepts it quickly. 3. The Noble Lie (myth of metals) Leap: Socrates proposes that society will function justly if people believe a myth about their natural roles (gold, silver, bronze souls). Problem: There’s no real justification for why such a falsehood guarantees stability or fairness — he just asserts it as \"necessary for harmony.\" Why it works: Adeimantus and Glaucon don’t press him on the ethics of lying, so the assumption slides by. 4. Philosopher-Kings as the Only Rulers Leap: He claims that since philosophers love truth and knowledge, only they can truly rule well. Problem: Loving truth doesn’t obviously imply political competence. Also, Socrates assumes philosophers wouldn’t be corrupted by power — a big leap. Why it works: The interlocutors admire the idea and let him idealize philosophers without addressing counterexamples. 5. Theory of Forms and the Form of the Good Leap: He introduces the Forms (especially the Form of the Good) as the foundation of all knowledge and morality. Problem: The dialogue never demonstrates the existence of Forms; Socrates uses metaphors (the Sun, the Divided Line, the Cave) instead of arguments. It’s persuasive imagery, not strict proof. Why it works: The metaphors are powerful, and his audience accepts them rather than demanding a rigorous account. 6. Justice as “Each Part Doing Its Own Work” Leap: After a long city-building exercise, Socrates concludes that justice = each part of the city (or soul) doing its proper work and not interfering with the others. Problem: This is more a definitional stipulation than a deductive conclusion. Why should we accept that this is the definition of justice rather than a definition?

I honestly don't know how this is waxing poetic or making logical leaps. It's basically a tautology since Socrates speaks about the philosopher king qua philosopher king and not merely a philospher king (i.e. the ideal ruler).

The Republic was that but for 200 pages. He just waxes poetic about shit and does logical leaps that his audience doesn't seem to catch because he's hypnotized them with the boredom of endless questions. They're proposing a utopian state which never came to be and never could have been. They make conclusions based on speculation on ideal behaivour from all participants based on their postulations. It's absolute trash for any modern man. Sure if I was born 3000 years ago my mind would probably explode from all of the wisdom.. But it has no value today...

I still think there is artistic merit in his dialogues and that this format is what puts certain people off from Plato as its unfamiliar, and I think that Diogenes Laertius account does seem correct based on what I have felt reading Plato but perhaps the artistic merit is more of a side effect as he uses the dialogue to express different psychological states as well as the dialectic approach to the highest ideal I'll try to do better next time around in this general."

Defining Justice by Analogy (the City–Soul analogy) Leap: Socrates argues that since justice is hard to see in an individual, we should look at it in a larger thing — the city — and then \"read it off\" back into the soul. Problem: Just because the structure of a city and the structure of an individual both involve \"parts,\" it doesn’t follow that the same principle (justice = harmony) applies identically in both. Why it works in the dialogue: His companions agree to the analogy and don’t demand proof that city/soul correspondence is valid. 2. Tripartite Division of the Soul Leap: He infers three parts of the soul (reason, spirit, appetite) because people sometimes experience internal conflict, like being thirsty but refusing to drink. Problem: From psychological conflict, it doesn’t strictly follow that there are literally three distinct \"parts\" of the soul. One could explain the conflict differently (e.g., competing desires of the same faculty). Why it works: The reasoning feels intuitive, and the group accepts it quickly. 3. The Noble Lie (myth of metals) Leap: Socrates proposes that society will function justly if people believe a myth about their natural roles (gold, silver, bronze souls).

Not only does it help one distinguish what might be original ideas from mere developments or rearticulations of already existing ones, but its also useful for clarifying some of the more esoteric references. Take Phaedo for instance, the dialogue ends with the hemlock working its way through Socrates: According to Philolaus: Therefore, there implication by Plato here is that Socrates' soul left his body at the point the cold reached his heart Previous Thread: Recent Plato-related threads:"

If we are to consider his dialogues as apocryphal (which I do) he would have to employ the skills he learned in crafting a dialogue in order to suit its purpose, which leads to the goal of producing a work of artistic merit in order to get the attention of the reader. I have read the Phaedrus and what he has to say about the arts does tell me he wrote with artistic merit in mind, but with the goal of reconciling his skill with philosophy but that this ultimately did not come to pass which is why by the time he wrote the 7th letter where he solidified his belief that such things couldn't be taught though art because it led to the same outcomes that lead people now into misinterpretation and a general feeling of unseriousness towards the writer."

(An example would be in the Republic; the description of the soul as having three parts that vie for rule means you can evaluate the \"characters\" by that description, according to who's ruled by calculation, spiritedness, or appetite, and also Socrates' responses according to how he says you bring balance to those. Another example would the Phaedo, where the exit of Socrates' wife with their newborn son should make us ask whether Socrates' description of the philosopher, as someone who doesn't care for bodily things like sex, is what he really believes and if we shouldn't approach the subsequent accounts with more caution.) Re: Phaedrus, that wasn't my take away from it, which I see as concerned with directing the appropriate speeches to the appropriate people. The talk of play there, if that's what you're thinking of, isn't about literary merit, for, as Socrates says about the man who plays with speeches about the just, the beautiful, and the good, \"much more beautiful, I think, is the seriousness that comes into being about these things, when someone using the dialectical art, taking hold of a fitting soul, plants and sows with knowledge speeches that are competent to assist themselves and him who planted and are not barren but have seed, whence other speeches, naturally growing in other characters, are competent to pass this on, ever deathless, and make him who has it experience as much happiness as is possible for a human being.\" That sounds more like a concern with teaching while being mindful of different audiences. As for the seventh letter, I have to correct that impression, but he doesn't say that; he says, rather: That sounds to me like a repetition of the point in Phaedrus, just put more bluntly."

I'm gonna reread it properly as Plato has always been a philosopher I've had to read twice over to extract some understanding, which is what I did with last days, Republic, Meno, Protagoras, Gorgias and Symposium. I still think there is artistic merit in his dialogues and that this format is what puts certain people off from Plato as its unfamiliar, and I think that Diogenes Laertius account does seem correct based on what I have felt reading Plato but perhaps the artistic merit is more of a side effect as he uses the dialogue to express different psychological states as well as the dialectic approach to the highest ideal I'll try to do better next time around in this general."

                "content": "To be clear, I don't disagree that there are strong literary qualities to the dialogues, I just don't see them as being for the sake of writing something literary. If you do get to reading Phaedrus again, a few things you might want to observe: - The second half at various points acts as a commentary on the first half. For example, Socrates, who has earlier spoken the long palinode as a correction of his first speech, now reveals that they were both one speech, in fact. (The first speech is an example of what the lover in the second speech, guided by the white horse, would say.) - Pretty close to the start of the palinode, Socrates says that what follows is really a kind of shortcut to understanding the soul, and that there's a longer account (he says this in the Republic as well). This leaves the matter of the longer account of soul an open question, and what about that account would be different or if something is left out or needs expanding upon. - There's a description of unifying experiences into an Idea in the palinode, there called Recollection, and it comes back up in the second half at least twice in a more rational description. - There's a passage in the second half where they start reading Lysias' speech again, and Socrates complains that it lacks what he calls \"speech-making necessity\" or \"logographic necessity\"; the specific complaint is that it lacks any necessary order (however that's to be understood), and he gives an example of a poem on a statue where any of the lines could be placed in any order indifferently, with no effect on the meaning. This seems to me to be where Plato lays out a standard by which we may want to read the dialogues, looking for not just a formal arrangement (intro, discussion, conclusion), but also for reasons for the order (take Symposium, which calls attention to the order of speeches by putting off Aristophanes' speech by his hiccuping until after Eryximachus, so that the last three speeches are by the two poets and Socrates)."

Also has two great detailed discussions of both the Alcibiades controversy, and all the Platonic interlocutors caught up in it, and the brief rule of the Thirty. A great reminder of things one can easily miss, e.g., that Socrates had a brother who may have been wealthy, that Polemarchus was murdered by the Thirty, that Callias had a position within the Mysteries, and that almost everyone present except for Aristophanes in the Symposium was either exiled from Athens or voluntarily fled in light of the accusations against Alcibiades. J.S. Morrison's \"Meno of Pharsalus, Polycrates, and Ismenias\": Tries to answer the question, \"what the hell is Meno of Thessaly doing in Athens?\" and goes over a detailed history of Thessaly's rocky political situation. Tl;dr of it is, \"the Thessalians didn't like the Spartans messing with them, and after the Athenians overthrew the Spartan installed Thirty, they sought Athens' help.\" Also helps to spell out how Meno ended up supporting Cyrus the Younger. Jacub Filonik's \"Athenian Impiety Trials: A Reappraisal\": The most thorough study of impiety trials available, trying to get to the bottom of how common or otherwise they were, late ancient exaggerations (e.g., whether Protagoras was ever prosecuted), and how often they resulted in the death penalty or something else. Kilian Fleischer's \"Philodem, Geschichte der Akademie\": A modern German translation and reconstruction of a history of the Academy that Philodemus was working on. If anyone recalls the stories coming out a year or two ago about Plato being sold into slavery by the Spartans or the story of his death (mocking a Thracian girl for being unable to keep rhythm playing a song the night before he succumbed to fever), it's from this. There's apparently plans for an English translation or edition, but I wouldn't expect it soon. Matthew Farmer's \"Playing the Philosopher: Plato in Fourth Century Comedy\": An inspection of the known comic fragments mentioning Plato, one of which is a parody on the opening of the Republic. Neat stuff. Myles Burnyeat's \"First Words\" in Explorations Vol. 2: Someone from the analytic tradition observing the relationship between the contents of the dialogues and the apparently unconnected opening lines. Very persuasive. Athenaeus' Deipnosophists: Not really a secondary work as normally understood, but book 11 has a long section where one of the characters criticizes Plato, and in the process shares all sorts of ancient gossip and accusations."

To borrow Aristotle's terms, I think we're supposed to see the universals through the particulars. Socrates is a stand in for a kind of philosopher (I hesitate to say philosophers in general, he appears to acknowledge such diversity by using Parmenides, Zeno, Timaeus, and the Strangers), but this goes for the other characters, where they're stand-ins for certain types of people, where our expectations and understanding of what's going on have to be adjusted accordingly. So you could raise the question that sometimes comes up about strawmen arguments or fallacies Socrates uses in this way: would someone like Cephalus be able to follow a longer and more precise account of anything? Would he be able to do so without getting upset if his longstanding opinions were wholly replaced by a philosophical understanding (i.e., could such a person live, if not happily in the fullest sense, at least well enough if it were to turn out that some of his deeply held hopes were dashed)? And this seems to arise out of Plato's reflection on his experiences, that human types will differ in both their estimation of what philosophy is and does, but also in how they come to philosophy. So I think the dramatic elements of character and circumstance re ment to be, on the one hand, merely engaging and harmless reading to someone who's not or not yet taken by philosophy, and on the other hand, as case studies of the manifold of phenomena to attend to if one must philosophize. I have a related point for my last comment. Lol das me I agree it would be more accessible, but I think Plato doesn't want it to be so accessible; people like Alcibiades, and Plato's own corrupt relatives, Charmides and Critias, are never far from his mind. And, his mentor having been put to death, out of suspicion that his questioning was politically motivated, seems to mean that Plato doesn't share our modern prejudice that one may more or less speak freely about all things as though the broader circumstances arpumd oneself are irrelevant. Aristotle, for his part, seems to have satisfied himself by keeping his treatises internal to his school, instead of publishing them. Again, some very thoughtful pushback."

The Republic was that but for 200 pages. He just waxes poetic about shit and does logical leaps that his audience doesn't seem to catch because he's hypnotized them with the boredom of endless questions. They're proposing a utopian state which never came to be and never could have been. They make conclusions based on speculation on ideal behaivour from all participants based on their postulations. It's absolute trash for any modern man. Sure if I was born 3000 years ago my mind would probably explode from all of the wisdom.. But it has no value today... Oh you might say it influenced this and that... But as work on its own and not a historical document, what is the value of it for the modern man?

I do like how it dedicates a section to the sophists to contextualize their arguments as I feel like Plato does kind of misrepresent them unfavorably for dramatic effect in his dialogues. Apart from that I'd say the best secondary source on Plato would probably just be Plotinus. I think the issue can be attributed to Plato's method of delivery rather than the actual substance behind Plato's writing. Plato tends to over complicate his writing for the sake of artistic and dramatic merit which leads to people losing track of the actual arguments being presented and how they are deduced. A lot of his thoughts could be told in fewer words but if he were to do that he would actually be making the logical leaps that people accuse him of making."

I'd also agree with what implies: his philosophy would probably have been more accessible had he written in a more direct and stripped-back format like Aristotle used, rather than attempt to communicate ideas through artistic devices."

So you could raise the question that sometimes comes up about strawmen arguments or fallacies Socrates uses in this way: would someone like Cephalus be able to follow a longer and more precise account of anything? Would he be able to do so without getting upset if his longstanding opinions were wholly replaced by a philosophical understanding (i.e., could such a person live, if not happily in the fullest sense, at least well enough if it were to turn out that some of his deeply held hopes were dashed)? And this seems to arise out of Plato's reflection on his experiences, that human types will differ in both their estimation of what philosophy is and does, but also in how they come to philosophy. So I think the dramatic elements of character and circumstance re ment to be, on the one hand, merely engaging and harmless reading to someone who's not or not yet taken by philosophy, and on the other hand, as case studies of the manifold of phenomena to attend to if one must philosophize. I have a related point for my last comment. Lol das me I agree it would be more accessible, but I think Plato doesn't want it to be so accessible; people like Alcibiades, and Plato's own corrupt relatives, Charmides and Critias, are never far from his mind. And, his mentor having been put to death, out of suspicion that his questioning was politically motivated, seems to mean that Plato doesn't share our modern prejudice that one may more or less speak freely about all things as though the broader circumstances arpumd oneself are irrelevant. Aristotle, for his part, seems to have satisfied himself by keeping his treatises internal to his school, instead of publishing them. Again, some very thoughtful pushback."

This is opposed to someone like Aristotle or Schopenhauer where they don't attempt at all to make their work have a dramatic or artistic merit and want to convey a thought or a message as simply and clearly as possible. I personally enjoy the dialogues and think Plato might be the best thinker out there but I can see how someone who is unfamilar with Greek literary traditions, which are heavily seeped in poetry and drama as they didn't grow up with it would look at Plato's work as unsatisfactory, illogical or unserious."

It may well be. Plotinus' writing comes another decade plus after leaving his teacher so the fact that he has abstracted away and Christian content doesn't really say much. Personally, I find the genealogy less important than that the idea of the One is obviously much changed from Plato and, particularly in its later Christian form, is pretty much immune to the attacks of Heidegger and the post-modern metaphysics of difference (Heidegger only studied late medieval nominalism, and being a grad student doesn't make one an expert. The fact is that his claims about ontotheology are explicitly refuted in the opening pages of many of the key earlier Christian texts, so the whole analysis rests on a backwards projection of a much later theology onto the earlier epochs). IMO, pic related represents the summit of these ideas. There are certainly worthwhile analyses and ideas from the Islamics and later Scholastic thinkers, but more seems to be lost than gained. Unfortunately, Eriugena, who appears to have considered himself an orthodox and faithful monk, and who was considered so by peers, is often today depicted as some sort of weird Medieval Hegel or pantheist to gin up interest. This is akin to \"Meister Eckhart the Buddhist\" or \"Eckhart the Gnostic,\" and results from anachronistic readings."

Why do you talk about authors you've hardly read? You got caught doing it with Heidegger, now here you are doing it again with Kant. I wonder if you've even read the Periphyseon or only the first few pages."

I am a former atheist, and am agnostic, not a Christian. But how is believing in the New Testament such an impossible leap of faith for Jews to make? It makes total sense, Jesus coming was prophesised, and then he came and they all happily had him killed. But then unlike others who saw the mistake and saw Jesus for who he was the Jew just decided \"No, there was not a mistake, Jesus was a liar, but we're still going to pretend we love Christians and that we are kindred brothers who come from a 'Judeo-Christian' culture and tradition.\" The Judeo and the Christian cannot co-exist religiously, one has to take precedent as the truth. Therefore, if you are a Christian, the Jew is no friend, and if you consider him one it should be your duty to bring him to Christ. If you are a Jew you should make peace with Christ and convert."

By my totally novice reading am I correct that such a list of regular tables would basically be similar (one big one for nouns + article, one big one for adjectives) but then where Dowling says to do a total of 4 verb tables, 2 voices each for 2 moods, Greek would have 3 voices each for 3 moods? It doesn’t seem like an absurd amount of increased work especially since I’m told middle and passive voice are mostly similar in spelling. It should take the total table count from 6 for Latin to 11 for Greek if I understand correctly, but then 3 of that increase is just middle voice. Thanks. I know the dialect is way different but I am just enamored by the idea of extensive homeric memorization."

When I started doing this it seemed so far off to learn the case system but really just sitting down with Dowling's wheel now that I have a bit of reading under my belt and brute forcing it until I can type the whole table from memory really wasn't difficult or all that time consuming. I would say I learned everything from Donum onwards on this table (as in learned to type it out in order) just doing it during classes, especially zoom classes, because it was mindless enough that it wasn't distracting but mindful enough that I didn't space out. I probably did an hour a day starting Monday and now I'm getting the whole table consistently before finishing my lectures on Wednesday. I figure adjectives will be much easier, and I spent some time with the verb tables and realized I already knew most of the tenses for a couple of the conjugation paradigms at least for the active voice. So overall I'm very happy with the \"carefully read first, review and systematize later\" approach to Latin"

Lots of people across the internet in spaces discussing Latin in particular basically just call other peoples' Latin, or even original works, \"bad latin\" without really offering advice or trying their hand at composing anything of their own in Latin. While I don't doubt that the aforementioned anon knows his shit, many other posts by other anons are so vague as to leave it totally ambiguous whether they are giving cogent advice or just sit at the peak of \"Mt. Stupid.\" in their Latin knowledge. I haven't seen that too much in what discourse exists for other languages, my Chinese friends IRL in particular have been overjoyed to help me with CC. Latin seems to have a unique problem with people who know Latin being resentful that anyone else is trying to learn it. It means that like a board like /fit/ I have taken extremely small pieces of cogent advice, and otherwise totally ignore most of the opinions I see on here, mostly browsing to remind myself that other people are doing the same hobby and that there is a community out there. The attitude that works best is to be a little more laid back, most of us here are students, many not even majoring in classics. Most are autodidacts."

But it's a bit strange how he spends about 4 pages going on about a boy being a nerd and ranking the \"alpha maleism\" of the other boys. He's constantly mentioning how big and strong this boy is. Think he mentioned the flying spaghetti monster and talked about male ego and sometimes it feels like 2 different people had their hand in this. One being Nick Cutter and the other a female Redditor. I don't know, just seems bizarre to me. It's not that I'm having a particularly bad time reading it, it's just little things like that take me out of it briefly before continuing. Not to mention he will spend a page describing the same thing with 4 different metaphors. Is it worth pushing through?"

It was a slog and unlike the Terror, which also drags, there were almost no stakes throughout the vast majority of the book. Just ramblings about parties and Charles Dickens being arrogant. I've read reviews that say the best part of Drood is the opening chapter, and I agree. As for Abominable, I don't remember much of it other than it's equally slow as Drood. I think that's just Simmons's way of writing in general, though. Sounds interesting. I'm looking forward to it!"

If you want to go for a classic, The Monk by Matthew Lewis is great, and while Melmoth the Wanderer (by Charles Maturin) has a long frame story set in a monastery that is claustrophobic, the entire novel is very long and slow, and I wouldn't really recommend it unless you specifically want to read something like that. The Black Spider by Jeremias Gotthelf is half religious allegory, half horror story, and overall just great if you're into books like that. It feels very much like a mythological story, and the actual horror is surprisingly cool for a novel from 1842."

If an author you like with a smaller following (no Wikipedia, fewer than 2k followers on social media) is releasing their first novel and first book with a major publisher, it’s worth 30 bucks to support them. 66% of books sell fewer than 1000 copies in the first year. There’s next to no press for this release. You are in the vast minority of people who know who this guy is and that he has a new book coming out.

That’s a classic move—define “critical theory” as the ugliest version of itself, collapse a broad intellectual tradition into a single style of bad prose, and pretend the entire field is a costume people wear to look smart. It’s a straw effigy built from cherry-picked jargon and classroom anecdotes, then set alight to warm a conclusion already decided. If the goal were understanding, you’d ask what the methods do, not how to bury them. “Multiple generations” is a vibe in place of evidence. Who, where, which syllabi, what outcomes? Conflating some scholars’ dense language with a curriculum-wide mandate is a slippery generalization. Every discipline has jargon; we don’t cancel physics because tensor calculus isn’t beach reading. The real question is whether particular concepts illuminate power, ideology, or identity in ways plain speech didn’t. Sometimes they do; sometimes they don’t; that’s why critique exists—even within critical theory. There’s also a bait-and-switch: equate clarity with virtue and complexity with deceit. But clarity can hide shallow thinking, and complexity can be the honest cost of naming tangled realities. The remedy for bad writing is good writing, not bonfires of ideas. If you’ve encountered work that mistakes opacity for depth, criticize it—specifically. Quote it, paraphrase it, test its claims. That’s called scholarship, and it doesn’t require a culture war. “Defeat” frames inquiry as an enemy camp. Start instead with questions that don’t rig the ending: What claims does a given theorist make? What evidence supports them? Where do their frameworks clarify, and where do they overreach? How do their terms translate into stakes in the world—law, labor, media, medicine? Read across disagreements: Adorno beside hooks, Foucault beside Fraser, Butler beside Appiah, then bring in critics who think they’re wrong. You will find vigorous argument already happening, because critique contains its own antibodies. If you want students to write better, teach revision, examples, and audience. Ask them to explain one hard idea twice: once for a peer in the field, once for a curious neighbor. Reward precision, not pretension. If you want fewer distortions online, stop rewarding thread-openers that beg the question and punch a scarecrow. Replace the “how do we defeat” posture with “how do we test, refine, and sometimes reject?” That’s how knowledge grows: not by burning forests, but by thinning them with care so more light gets in."

Please reformat it and try again.\" One thing I was originally trying to say was I liked how Cathérine connects Patrice and fascism to a fantasy/dream. It's something that can't exist in the real world and provides no support. Cathérine ultimately rejects Patrice, thus rejecting fascism. I imagine Brassilach saw this as symbolizing Europe/Democracy rejecting fascism."

Patrice and Cathérine meet near the end of their high school studies. She is 18; he, 20. They spend a magical month or two in the summer together where they achieve a perfect union without a carnal consumation. Patrice must then go do his mandatory year of military service. After that is over Patrice heads off to Italy to be a tutor and to learn about Italian fascism. During this time Patrice and Cathérine exchange letters and slowly drift apart. Cathérine become enamoured with the (at-first) communist François (but later fascist). Will Patrice and Cathérine reunite? The book is notable for its style where its seven chapters are written in seven different narrative styles. It nearly won the Prix Goncourt in 1939 (one of France's highest literary honors)."

If you never see firsthand the framework and just get the info, it will be a lot harder to get these paradigm shift moments where your own worldview is challenged and can grow and develop. Wikipedia (or ChatGPT I guess though I do not recommend) for instance can give you a taste of the concepts at play but can't really help you connect the work to your life. Think about it this way: whatever text you are reading you are subject to the comprehension framework/worldview of the writer. ChatGPT literally has no worldview so you can't grow your own from reading it. I hope this is helpful."
