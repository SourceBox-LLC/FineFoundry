I think in total my wolf suit cost me $1500. Took me a while to put it together. A friend of mine got invested in it too and he also had a wolf suit, but white and grey while mine was just grey. We used to mess around at his place. Nothing actually gay. Just wrestling around, making weird noises, pretending to kiss, yeah, we were freaks. We were mainly just talking through scenarios. But eventually we acknowledged that we were both as hard as iron under the suits. We ended up cutting the suits so that we could access each other. I ended up blowing a 6'6\" wolf on his bedroom couch while his mother made pasta downstairs. I will never forget having a giant pair of clawed paws pulling my head down onto a wide rigid shaft. He rewarded me a week later, when we both furred up, and I bred him on my bed. Half a bottle of Lubido (water based and easy to wash out of fur) and I was able to push into him fairly easily. About 10 minutes of gentle doggy, before I got him in a mating press and hammered his asshole. I fucking loved dominating him. We exchanged cum for about 6 months and started to get bored. I ended up getting a girlfriend and then I got her pregnant... So yeah, being a furry can just be a phase."

I remember once when I was at a comic shop looking at that years The Best American Comics and this fucking nerd walks up to me and starts talking weeb shit and I was like, this experience has turned awful. I just started a new job this week and was able to use the experience I already had to negotiate a higher salary. So it's working, and one day I'll be abke to apply to, like, an executive chef position and make crazy money. What are your two jobs? Are they both to do with system admin? And are they paying you properly?\n\nYep, and for the longest time I thought they were just fine people...until I had to learn networking. That and linux. It looks like you're going up in the world. Soon we'll be seeing you in one of gordon ramsey's restaurants, lol. The job I currently have, been having, is office worker. However, I also agreed to do IT work on the side. I am compensated for the work I do in computers and the likes.\n\nKnotssssss\n\nI don't think I'd vibe well in one of those super fancy restaurants with all, like, foamed bullshit and gourmet whatever. My approach to cooking is simple dishes, simple ingredients, and being respectful of the history of what I am making. Whenever I go somewhere and I see something like tacos, or whatever other peasant food, and they're made all gourmet and expensive I become enraged. Good boy, don't let the bosses take advantage.\n\nhelp me worldbuild. we all have our little fantasy scenario we imagine when we are laying in bed trying to sleep or at the computer with nothing to do. that little thing you think about. right now im just sorta letting anything go and seeing if it sticks. 3 people from 2 different franchises i like get teleported into the pokemon world. its shinji ikari, asuka langley and lan hikari (evangelion and megaman). im self inserting as lan hikari, hes the youngest and smallest. these two different groups get teleported into the pokemon world, but its one without humans at all. they get captured and held captive by the gardevoir/gallade community/tribe that happened to be nearby where they teleported in. lan and asuka/shinji dont know each other. lan's from a place without angels or eva's, and shinji/asuka have never seen/heard of basically sentient a.i like megaman.exe. not really that important, just that they have separate realities and they dont mesh, and they dont know each other. so they get captured, they are confused, the gardevoirs/gallades are investigating, looking and examining these weird, nearly gardevoir/gallade shaped things and wondering what to do with them. when the current kerfuffle calms down, a male gardevoir (blue shiny) and a few others show up and get let into the cell, and gravitates to lan. the blue male gar starts to undress, examine lan, who is obviously confused and terrified, then starts to just...suck him off. lans never had anything like that happen to him, hes never orgasmed, doesn't know what it is at all, but the gard just forces it upon him cont before i run out of space (pic semi related. it is technically fur, its zero and x as dolphins doing reasonably gay looking activities)\n\nso poor lan has been forcibly milked agaisnt his will, for the first time. no idea what just happened to him, and hes looking over at shinji and asuka, strangers, but human, so \"on his side\" looking for help, and they just cant. nothing they can do. the weird gay shiny blue gardevoir just keeps checking him out. not completely sexual, hes investigating the very nature of lan or humans, hes never seen them before. running his hands, palms all over lans body, pushing under the ribcage, pushing its \"fingers\" into lans eye socket, nostrils, ear canal, so on, so fourth. then he starts fooling around a little around poor old lans backside. lan doesnt even know gay people exist, or what gay is, hes just being traumatized by this weird alien that can just mind control him and pierces his thoughts somehow. this is where i get stuck. i got the setting, the situation, but i dont know where to take it from there. i just keep mentally imagining this situation and getting stuck at this point",

The Japanese high command themselves knew it was a gamble, and they knew that if the war dragged on for longer than six months or so after attacking the Brits and the Americans then no matter what they would lose. The gamble was that they would be successful enough in the first six months of the war that the Allies would sue for peace and as part kf the peace treaty they would recognize Japan's territorial gains in Manchuria. The gamble, of course, didn't work. The Doolittle Raid in April 1942, while dling relatively little damage to Japanese infrastructure on mainland Japan, signaled to the Japanese that they had grossly underestimated America's fighting capabilities so quickly after the success of Pearl Harbor as well as greatly boosted the morale of Americans back home. Then on June 4th 1942 the Battle of Midway completely shifted the tide of the war so dramatically that Japan had no hope of ever recovering.\n\nWell remember, you're the one hogtied. I'm just riding on top. It's a power move bucko I'm not entirely sure of that. They had the Chinese on the run for some time, even with all the other battles going on in the pacific, but, it was unsustainable in the long run. China's a huge place with a lot of volatile regions. There's a good chance that at some point someone would run a campaign against the Japanese and push them completely off the continent. Plus the Russian's were ready to pursue the Japanese at a later point during WW2, and that would have been the finishing move for the Japanese.\n\nHuh, I'm not sure I've ever had haddock in general. I don't eat a lot of fried fish though, I prefer it grilled or cooked in a pan. I would be hogtied, but shouldn't you be the one inside of me? While it is true that China is a big place, the Japanese weren't interested in all of China. They wanted Manchuria. The Japanese were 100% ready to end hostilities with China if the Chinese agreed to recognize the Japanese puppet state of Manchuko. As for the Soviets, they weren't ever going to attack the Japanese. They had a nonagression pact with them that they desperately wanted to maintain to avoid fighting a war on two fronts. So if the Japanese could have achieved the swift end they desperately needed after Pearl Harbor then the Soviets wouldn't have been a threat at all. But even before that the Soviets were largely uninterested in getting into a conflict with the Japanese over China. Early in the Second Sino-Japanese War the Soviets provided some support for Chang Kai-Shek, but it was extremely limited in scope and did next to nothing as far as stopping Japanese territorial advancement.\n\nUh you'll be tied in a different fashion. Your arms will be tied together, so that your face is down and your ass is up. Then the legs could also be tied to keep you from moving. I'll be on top of all this. The soviets also had one with the Germans, however, there was good evidence to suggest that the Soviets were planning to break and attack later on anyways. I guess the Soviets were only interested in Japan midway during WW2, thanks to Japanese blunders.\n\nOh, oh my. Yes, this sounds much much better. A much more fitting place for me. The Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, yes. However, due to the failing of that pact the Soviets scrambled to join a nonagression pact with Japan. In fact, the Japanese emissary who was sent to negotiate with Stalin was embraced before his departure and thanked for savingthe Soviets from having to fight a two front war. It wasn't until very close to the end of WWII that the Soviets had any interest in Japanese territorial gains, however, it was also the Soviets that tried, prior to the dropping of the a-bombs, to broker a peace agreement between the Allies and the Japanese.",

We used to mess around at his place. Nothing actually gay. Just wrestling around, making weird noises, pretending to kiss, yeah, we were freaks. We were mainly just talking through scenarios. But eventually we acknowledged that we were both as hard as iron under the suits. We ended up cutting the suits so that we could access each other. I ended up blowing a 6'6\" wolf on his bedroom couch while his mother made pasta downstairs. I will never forget having a giant pair of clawed paws pulling my head down onto a wide rigid shaft. He rewarded me a week later, when we both furred up, and I bred him on my bed. Half a bottle of Lubido (water based and easy to wash out of fur) and I was able to push into him fairly easily. About 10 minutes of gentle doggy, before I got him in a mating press and hammered his asshole. I fucking loved dominating him. We exchanged cum for about 6 months and started to get bored. I ended up getting a girlfriend and then I got her pregnant... So yeah, being a furry can just be a phase.",

I'll have to use the weekend to straighten out my days and nights but today was so nice and cozy it was well worth it.\n\nYou gave her the gun, and the hand! Kidding aside, that image makes me think of Index claimer. So how is your weekend starting off? That's nice. Sometimes your system needs the sleep, whether it's for mental reasons or for the body to fight infection, or everything simply externally aligns to make it the perfect conditions for restful sleep.\n\nAre there any girls that get cuter with a gun. (Not counting girls that force you to say they're cuter while holding you at gunpoint.) Index the character from Index, or Kuroko (had to look that up) claimer, who is also from the same series. I thought Index the character at first. When I first started posting on this site and was told I should post with a persistent avatar, I picked Index.

But then we wouldn’t have met.\n\nwhat a pity, letting such a perfectly fine pussy go to waste from underuse. i can teach her how to give proper blowjobs if you lend her to me for a week or two.\n\npardon if any of my words sound too sexually aggressive. i want to clarify i'm not some clueless larper commenting on everyone's wives, but have a lot of irl experience with 3-somes, 4-somes, larger groups, swinging, and dominating sluts of all sorts in any number of ways. rest assured i know what i'm talking about when i tell you that nasty slut of a whore you call your wife should have been left free for another year or two until she got railed enough times that she had learned the very basics. personally i wouldn't even think of dating that asian cumslut before she'd been fucked by ten or twelve men at the very least. always leave the shit blowjobs and pussy stretching sessions to the losers ready to do the boring work that's necessary to teach the dumb little cunt which end of the cock goes in her mouth. but it's never too late to give that cumdumpster chink fucktoy you married some proper training. if she was my bitch, i'd just drag her sorry gash all the way to the nearest swinger/sex club and make her speedrun all the missing cocks by making her fuck one guy after the other until she reached a decent number in as few evenings as possible.",

And then when we were married she fucked 2 (that I know of) on the downlow. It's been a few years since divorce so I'd guess she became a slut again right after and say anywhere from 30 to 50 guys. Lesson learned? Don't date a slut and expect her to be loyal or honest, and don't marry when you're young. I fell for a cheating slut because she was hot and had big tits and that's on me."

The whole \"pure virgin\" thing seems like a you're just fetishizing a girl's innocence.\n\nI think its more worrying that you seem to think that sex is some complex thing that women can only improve on by being fucked by as many men as possible.",

That means she at least fucked enough beforehand to know what a man likes, and isn't awkward with her movements or shy about what she wants."

Mostly them kissing her all over and eating her pussy. She would let them all finish on her tits. She’s a squirter, so I think that was the main reason people would request her. Later it made sense, she always wants me to cum on her tits, and she give amazing handjobs. I remember thinking how odd it was when we started dating.

How dare you make me expose AI to such hate speech filled nazi propaganda! (pic rel) That said, help me improve this frens (I have no clue about music since middle school orchestra class btw): [Title: The Movement Rises] [Intro] (Ethereal synth pad, hypnotic beat slowly fades in. A single piano chord echoes.) (Female soprano vocal ad-lib, a high, haunting 'ooh'.) [Verse 1] (Beat becomes more pronounced, cello and bass add a deep, resonant layer.) (Mezzo-Soprano) A whisper started, then a roar A feeling felt from shore to shore They called us silent, lost, unseen But we're the pulse of a new scene We stand for what we know is right In darkest shadows, we bring light. [Chorus] (Music swells. Drums kick in with more energy. Violins and violas add a soaring, epic melody.) (All Vocals - Soprano on harmony, Alto on low harmony) The movement rises, a powerful tide With every heartbeat, side by side! They tried to stop us, tried to doubt But listen closely, hear us shout! (Alto shouts) AWOO! (Mezzo-Soprano responds) AWOO! (Soprano responds with a high, melodic) AWOO! (All together, with powerful resonance) AWOO! [Verse 2] (Beat breaks down slightly, becomes more ambient. The piano takes the lead with a simple, hypnotic arpeggio.) (Alto) They laughed at our beliefs, they said we were naive But now they see the strength we hold, the truth we all believe We're here to mend what's broken, to build it up anew A new beginning, a fresh start for me and you. [Breakdown] (Beat drops to a minimal, pulsing rhythm. Strings create a tense, building atmosphere.) (Call and Response - Mezzo-Soprano and Alto) (Mezzo-Soprano) It's more than a sound... (Alto) It's a revolution! (Mezzo-Soprano) It's more than a feeling... (Alto) It's a solution! (Soprano - ad-lib) We will not be silenced!",

In particular, a player X who is witting of these strategies can (i) deterministically set her opponent Y’s score, independently of his strategy or response, or (ii) enforce an extortionate linear relation between her and his scores. Against such a player, an evolutionary player’s best response is to accede to the extortion.

Didn't read the rest.\n\nIf people were promiscuous while having access to birth control then who gives a shit?\n\nPeople are promiscuous with access to birth control already moron, the problem is they don't fucking use it. They treat abortion as a form of birth control. Guess what prevents rampant abortions? Sterilizations.\n\nAre you under the impression that I care how many abortions people are having? The concern is unwanted babies being born. And abortion rates have gone down consistently since the 80’s, with all time lows in recent years even before the repeal of Roe v Wade, mainly due to education around sex being greater and more access to birth control. Most people don’t have abortions, so your ranting about promiscuity is irrelevant.\n\nWow very cool, my point still stands. Start sterilizing promiscuous women who have no problem having seven baby daddies or are on their fifth abortion. Now watch how fast both problems solve themselves.",

The God of the Bible was the God of the Aryans 1500 years BEFORE the Jews ever existed. It's right there in the Greek Bible. God made a promise to the father of the Aryans that He would enlarge him and bless him. He was the God of the Aryans FIRST! Christ was the Son of the God of the Universe, not the God of the Jews. The first covenants God made were to Adam, Eve, Noah and his sons... NONE OF THEM WERE JEWISH! Moses wrote the Torah and he wasn't Jewish.

I did a lot of frankly schizo shit, music videos in my head, prayers, void grasping, all alone under the moonlight. It all sorta just stopped abruptly, around mid July. no desire too go nightwalk. Sleeping better. lost a job. Smoking now not just vaping, got new bong kek. But these threads have been so interesting to me because the calendar lined up, and this year has been the first year of my life I have recognized a connection between my emotional frame/spirit and the moon/astrology. I outright denied it before, we only met once but my diagnosed schizo grandpa gave me a telescope and it might've been for a reason. Chicken and egg, it's a bit hard to prove; but know that I am being cognizant of my actions and observations. Less moves the better.\n\nYeah, astrology wins you like that.

        "output": "Anyway, I'm that anon, let's clarify some terms: The \"whiplash\" is the worst thing that happens in the mercury shadow after it had gone direct. The shadow comes in two parts, in the first one, mercury stops and turns direct, it needs to pick up speed from going to stopped to full speed, this causes it to be at different speeds all the time, accelerating, which causes things to get bizarre and unstable, specially on the critical days where it happens, which was August 10-11. NOTE this isn't about bad things happening, it's about the most unlikely things happening, so plans get ruined and have to be changed because you literally can't prepare for them. The second part of the aftershadow happens when mercury is at full speed, but it hasn't yet reached the point where it started being retrograde, so it already went through this part. Here things get undone or have to be done again, history repeats itself, you find yourself doing again what you did on the preshadow period, mercury retrograde or in previous mercury retrograde periods. Here's where the whiplash tends to happen and may be a punishment for doing something important in these periods, though, it's mostly as if you didn't do them so it's a waste of time. The shift from the first part to the second is happening August 15-16, be careful unless the whiplash already happened. Finally we have the last critical day when mercury reaches the point where it stopped to become retrograde and reaches new places it hasn't gone through before yet, causing a last critical day where the tailwhip happens. It's supposed to be in August 24-25, but in my experience, it tends to happen when you're relieved and think \"it's finally over and I can continue living my life normally!\" you let your guard down, and then it hits. It may be the worst because you weren't ready or expecting anything, if you're ready it may not even be worse than the whiplash or critical days.

        "output": "No it doesn't, it states that a benevolent, all-powerful and all-knowing god wouldn't allow this universe to exist, there's still room for the existence of a benevolent god in general The vast majority of matter in this reality is not alive and does not participate in the consumption of other matter Even among living things, predation isn't a universal constant, plants can survive without eating anything alive (they still need to absorb nutrients from the air and soil but they don't have to kill anything for that) There's no reason to think that higher beings would need to do something so primitive as to consume other beings for survival"
