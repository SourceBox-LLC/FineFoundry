You're not going to change the guy by denying him service, you're if anything going to enforce whatever it is you find negative about him. You also damage international relations which is much bigger than your karma farming protest. Now if the USA had come out and said we're going to back Putin and help him reform the USSR, then sure, hell I would expect him to be escorted out of the country, but throwing out the word fascist like this ends up dangerously diluting/misappropriating a word's meaning. The lack of an ability to behave rationally with the opposition is dead, it's really sad imo. I think it is a both sides problem when it comes to each sides core voter base, but it's becoming increasingly evident to me the supporters of the left are becoming more unhinged in this regard. What have they actually achieved here? Now if they had a Ukrainian flag, that's imo fine. Let's a message be sent to Vance this establishment supports Ukraine, he can do with that whatever he wants. Regardless of politics and folks views on how past administrations have performed, the scene where McCain told that supporter Obama was a decent family man is the type of thing which has sadly vanished. I feel like politics all over the world has descended into this tribal sports team like mentality for too many people. It's reflected both in politicians and then feeds down into the population itself. I think we're less because of it frankly."

It's drugs, mental health, and if they have them, families that don't give a shit about them. It's not a secret. People that are out and down on their luck tend to find a way back off the streets, they find a way to leverage the meager services into helping themselves. The political machines in blue states, where this is a huge problem fleece the public for billions promising shelters and recovery centers etc, and the money disappears and the problem gets worse. The shelters are understaffed by unqualified individuals, rife with drugs and SA, and very rarely get anyone 'off' the streets. \"Ok you're here, you have 30 days to get your shit together\" revolving door in most of these places, and most of these people are on the streets because they CAN'T get their shit together and have no where else to go. So they're out for 30 days and then they bring in a new crop to do the same thing to. And then you talk to some of the coherent ones that end up on the west coast, and they're fucking loving life. If you can acclimate to living in a tent in temperatures that aren't THAT extreme (which is pretty easy tbh) it's fucking great. No responsibility, they give you cash, your healthcare is paid for (Good luck getting into mental health, or even finding a provider who isn't some 24 year old with a certificate) if you want it. Sure they come in to bulldoze your homeless camp every few months, but you just move back to the one they chased you off of before. But hey you don't have to deal with any of that working or paying 50% of your check in taxes, or being held accountable to the laws. Source: I'm a physician in a private practice that takes medicaid in a so-deep-blue-its-almost-black area that drives past 4 separate huge camps on his 8 minute drive to work. They're out there because because drugs, mental health, because they want to be, and democrats enable it for political points with the blue hairs and hippy boomers. That's the answer. Where do they go? No idea, but we all pay too fkn much tax in these states to have to put up with it."

But the callous incompetency is generating public blowback: nobody minds when they *actually* deport illegal aliens, especially criminals. It's the sloppy, poor execution that catches up innocents in the net that is causing all the stress. It's a self-inflicted wound. Teach the troops to do their jobs well, in the light of day and all that, and they'd be *respected* like local beat cops instead of lawless cosplay bros, which is a much better way to build a long-term solution here.
