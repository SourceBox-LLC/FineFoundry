# Proxy Configuration

This page will cover how to run FineFoundry behind HTTP/SOCKS proxies and Tor.

Planned topics:

- Environment variables used by the helper modules (e.g. proxy URLs, authentication)
- How to configure Tor for use with the scrapers
- Notes on performance, reliability, and safe usage

For now, see the Scrape tab user guide for high-level behavior:

- [Scrape Tab](../user-guide/scrape-tab.md)
