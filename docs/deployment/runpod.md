# Runpod Setup

This page will document how FineFoundry integrates with Runpod for remote training.

Planned topics:

- Creating and configuring a Network Volume (typically mounted at `/data`)
- Creating and reusing Pod Templates
- How the Training tab maps to Runpod infrastructure
- Where logs and outputs are stored on the volume

For now, see the Training tab guide for an end-user overview:

- [Training Tab](../user-guide/training-tab.md)
