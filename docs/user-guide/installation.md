# Installation

This page will eventually provide a focused, step‑by‑step installation guide for FineFoundry.

Until then, use these sources for setup:

- The main project **README** – installation and quick start instructions.
- The **Quick Start Guide** – end‑to‑end walkthrough from clone to first dataset.

Planned topics for this page:

- Supported platforms and Python versions (3.10+)
- Creating a virtual environment
- Installing dependencies (via `uv` or `pip`)
- Launching the GUI and verifying that everything works
