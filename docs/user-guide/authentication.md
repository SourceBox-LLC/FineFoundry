# Authentication

FineFoundry uses external services such as **Hugging Face** and **Runpod**. This page will eventually provide a single place to learn how to configure
those credentials.

For now, the most up‑to‑date information lives in:

- [Settings Tab](settings-tab.md) – where to paste/save tokens and API keys.
- The main README section on Hugging Face tokens.

Planned topics for this page:

- Hugging Face Hub tokens (environment variables, CLI login, Settings tab)
- Runpod API key configuration
- Recommended practices for storing and testing credentials
