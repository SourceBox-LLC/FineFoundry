# GUI Overview

This guide provides a high-level tour of the FineFoundry desktop interface and links to detailed tab-specific guides.

When you launch the app you will see several tabs across the top:

1. **Scrape** – Collect raw conversational data.
2. **Build / Publish** – Turn JSON into structured datasets and optionally push to Hugging Face.
3. **Training** – Fine-tune models on Runpod or locally via Docker.
4. **Inference** – Run inference against fine-tuned adapters with prompt history and Full Chat View.
5. **Merge Datasets** – Combine multiple datasets from different sources.
6. **Dataset Analysis** – Inspect dataset quality and statistics.
7. **Settings** – Configure authentication, proxies, and Ollama integration.
