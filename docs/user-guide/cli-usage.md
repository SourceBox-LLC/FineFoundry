# CLI Usage

FineFoundry includes command‑line entry points for some operations (for example, dataset building and scraping) in addition to the GUI.

This page will eventually collect:

- Example commands for running the scrapers from the CLI
- Usage patterns for `src/save_dataset.py` and related helpers
- Tips for integrating CLI tools into automation or CI workflows

Until this page is expanded, you can:

- Use the **Quick Start Guide** and individual tab guides to understand end‑to‑end flows.
- Inspect `src/save_dataset.py` and `src/scrapers/` directly when wiring custom scripts.

For a higher‑level overview of features, see:

- [Quick Start Guide](quick-start.md)
- [GUI Overview](gui-overview.md)
