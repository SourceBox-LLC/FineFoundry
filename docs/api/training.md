# Training API

This page will document FineFoundry's programmatic training interfaces.

The primary implementation lives under:

- `src/helpers/training.py`
- `src/helpers/training_pod.py`
- `src/runpod/ensure_infra.py`
- `src/runpod/runpod_pod.py`

Planned topics:

- Launching and monitoring training jobs programmatically
- Runpod vs. local Docker training flows
- Configuration objects and how they map onto the GUI Training tab
