# Stack Exchange Scraper

FineFoundry's Stack Exchange scraper is implemented in `src/scrapers/stackexchange_scraper.py`.

It focuses on scraping question/answer pairs (typically accepted answers) suitable for supervised training.

Topics to document here:

- Which Stack Exchange sites are supported
- How questions and answers are selected and cleaned
- Any rate limiting or API usage considerations
