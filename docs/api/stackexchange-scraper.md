# Stack Exchange Scraper

FineFoundry's Stack Exchange scraper is implemented in `src/scrapers/stackexchange_scraper.py`.

It focuses on scraping question/answer pairs (typically accepted answers) suitable for supervised training.

Key considerations include:

- Which Stack Exchange sites are supported.
- How questions and answers are selected and cleaned.
- Rate limiting and API usage considerations.

For a high‑level overview of all scrapers, see the **[Scrapers API](scrapers.md)** page.
