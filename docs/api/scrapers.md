# Scrapers API

High-level reference for FineFoundry's scraping interfaces.

This page provides an overview of the scraper modules under `src/scrapers/` and links to the more detailed per-source pages:

- [4chan Scraper](fourchan-scraper.md)
- [Reddit Scraper](reddit-scraper.md)
- [Stack Exchange Scraper](stackexchange-scraper.md)

Implementation lives in:

- `src/scrapers/fourchan_scraper.py`
- `src/scrapers/reddit_scraper.py`
- `src/scrapers/stackexchange_scraper.py`

Future iterations can add full parameter tables, examples, and CLI usage for each scraper.
