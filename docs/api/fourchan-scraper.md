# 4chan Scraper

FineFoundry's 4chan scraper is implemented in `src/scrapers/fourchan_scraper.py`.

It supports scraping posts and replies from selected boards and building training pairs (e.g. quote chains or contextual groupings). Use this page as a starting point for documenting:

- Supported boards and configuration options
- Pairing strategies (adjacent vs. contextual)
- Cleaning / normalization steps
