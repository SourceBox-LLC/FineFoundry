# 4chan Scraper

FineFoundry's 4chan scraper is implemented in `src/scrapers/fourchan_scraper.py`.

It supports scraping posts and replies from selected boards and building training pairs (for example, quote chains or contextual groupings).

Key topics when working with the 4chan scraper include:

- Supported boards and configuration options.
- Pairing strategies (adjacent vs. contextual).
- Cleaning / normalization steps.

For an overview of all scrapers, see the **[Scrapers API](scrapers.md)** page.
