# Reddit Scraper

FineFoundry's Reddit scraper is implemented in `src/scrapers/reddit_scraper.py`.

It provides both a library interface and a CLI for scraping subreddits or individual submissions, expanding "more" comments, and building conversational training pairs.

When working with the Reddit scraper, pay attention to:

- CLI flags and environment variables.
- Subreddit vs. single‑post flows.
- Pair‑building strategies and filters.

For concrete CLI examples, see **[CLI Usage](../user-guide/cli-usage.md)**. For an overview of all scrapers, see the **[Scrapers API](scrapers.md)** page.
