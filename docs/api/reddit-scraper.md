# Reddit Scraper

FineFoundry's Reddit scraper is implemented in `src/scrapers/reddit_scraper.py`.

It provides both a library interface and a CLI for scraping subreddits or individual submissions, expanding "more" comments, and building conversational training pairs.

Use this page to document:

- CLI flags and environment variables
- Subreddit vs. single-post flows
- Pair-building strategies and filters
