# Code Style

This page will describe coding standards and conventions for FineFoundry.

Planned topics:

- Python style (imports, naming, error handling, logging)
- How we use Ruff and type hints (mypy)
- UI/controller patterns for the Flet-based GUI

Until this page is fully fleshed out, use the existing code in `src/helpers/` and `src/ui/` as a reference and run:

- `uv run ruff check src`
- `uv run mypy`

before opening a pull request.
