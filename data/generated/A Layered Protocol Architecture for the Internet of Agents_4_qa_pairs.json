  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nThe current protocols for multi-agent systems, such as A2A and MCP, excel at standardizing the syntactic envelope of communication, but fail to manage the context of tasks and shared understanding of terms. This leads to brittle, unpredictable, and inefficient systems. To address this issue, a new architectural stack is proposed, which separates the application transport layer (HTTP/2/3) from the agent communication layer (L8 and L9). The Agent Communication Layer (L8) ensures that agents can reliably exchange structured messages, understand communicative intent, and coordinate interaction flows, independently of semantic content. This layer provides a standardized foundation for agent communication, unifying the best parts of existing protocols into a single, standardized layer.",
