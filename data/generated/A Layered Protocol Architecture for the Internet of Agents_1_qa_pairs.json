  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nThe integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with domain-specific languages (DSLs) and compilers can enable distributed programming using agents, but lacks inherent correctness guarantees. Current agent communication protocols, such as A2A and FIPA-ACL, only validate syntax but do not ensure semantic agreement, leading to challenges in reliable agent-to-agent communication. The \"Internet of Agents\" (IoA) aims to address this gap by providing a communication infrastructure that enables semantic coordination and guarantees both computational efficiency and correctness. However, current protocols fail to address the critical failure modes of syntax without semantic context and semantic underspecification, which can lead to expensive disambiguation and undermine deterministic behavior.",
