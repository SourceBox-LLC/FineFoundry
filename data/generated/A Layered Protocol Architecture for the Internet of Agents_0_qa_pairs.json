  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nThe \"Internet of Agents\" (IoA) is proposed as a communication stack that enables agents to scale by distributing computation across collaborating entities. To address the limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs), a new layered protocol architecture is proposed, consisting of an Agent Communication Layer (L8) and an Agent Semantic Negotiation Layer (L9). L8 standardizes message envelopes, speech-act performatives, and interaction patterns, while L9 formalizes the meaning of communication, enabling agents to discover, negotiate, and lock a \"Shared Context\" that defines the concepts, tasks, and parameters relevant to their interaction. This architecture aims to provide the foundation for scalable, distributed agent collaboration, enabling the next generation of multi-agentic systems.",
