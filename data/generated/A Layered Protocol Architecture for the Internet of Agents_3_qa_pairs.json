  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nThe development of HTTP/3, which is based on QUIC, has established HTTP as a universal transport layer for modern applications. Beyond its transport capabilities, HTTP also serves as a secure layer for authentication and authorization, providing application-level security mechanisms. However, as the Internet of Agents (IoA) emerges, the need for high-level agent communication protocols becomes increasingly important to avoid the ad-hoc \"swamp\" of proprietary protocols. To address this, the authors propose to formalize the primitives of agent communication by explicitly defining two new layers for the IoA stack. This would enable standardized and interoperable agent communication protocols.",
