  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nThe paper proposes a solution to the problem of ambiguous and non-deterministic agent communication in multi-agent systems, where agents must negotiate and clarify the meaning of messages to execute tasks efficiently. To address this issue, the authors propose a new architectural layer, the Agent Semantic Negotiation Layer (L9), which establishes shared meaning before task execution, and a standardized interaction structure, the Agent Communication Layer (L8). This combination enables agents to validate semantic correctness at the protocol level, eliminating ambiguity and ensuring deterministic and efficient execution. The authors draw inspiration from the evolution of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) from an ad-hoc application protocol to a universal transport foundation, highlighting the importance of formal syntax and semantic knowledge in agent communication.",
