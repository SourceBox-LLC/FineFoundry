 ‘military-logistics:v3.2‘ or
‘high-frequency-trading:v1.0‘ exposes strategic information.
Where SLIM uses MLS for payload encryption, the L9 nego-
tiation messages (SNL-HELLO, SNL-SELECT) must also be
encrypted using the same end-to-end security mechanism,
ensuring that even intermediate routing nodes cannot ob-
serve capability advertisements. This requires extending
the secure channel established at L7 to cover L9 control
messages.

5.3 Trust Model and Governance
The Schema Authority (SA) model raises critical governance ques-
tions. We envision a federated trust model, analogous to how TLS
certificates operate:

• Centralized SAs for Public Contexts: Industry consor-
tiums or standards bodies (e.g., "Travel Industry Agent Pro-
tocol Alliance") would operate SAs for widely-used public
contexts like ‘travel‘, ‘ecommerce‘, or ‘healthcare‘. These
SAs would sign context definitions, publish revocation lists,
and manage version lifecycles. Agents would ship with root
SA certificates, similar to browsers shipping with CA root
certificates.

• Decentralized/Self-Signed for Private Contexts: Or-
ganizations deploying internal multi-agent systems could
self-sign private contexts (e.g., ‘urn:contexts:acme-internal-
logistics:v1.0‘). Agents within the organization’s trust bound-
ary would accept the organization’s SA certificate. This
enables private semantic coordination without external de-
pendencies.

• Federation Across Boundaries: Cross-organizational col-
laboration requires trust bridging. Agent A (trusting SA-
Financial) and Agent B (trusting SA-Healthcare) could inter-
act if their SAs have established mutual recognition agree-
ments, or through a trusted intermediary SA. This mirrors
federated identity systems (SAML, OAuth, OpenID Con-
nect).

• Context Lifecycle: SAs must handle context updates (mi-
nor version bumps for backward-compatible changes, major
versions for breaking changes) and revocations (if a con-
text is found to have security vulnerabilities). Agents must
periodically refresh SA certificates and check revocation
lists, adding operational complexity but ensuring semantic
integrity over time.

This governance model is complex but necessary. The alternative—
no semantic authentication—would allow any malicious actor to
publish poisoned contexts, undermining the entire L9 value propo-
sition.

6 Implementation and Challenges
The L8/L9 architecture is not a replacement for existing protocols
but rather a formalization and extension of capabilities already
emerging in modern agent communication standards. Our proposal
leverages and builds upon existing implementations to provide a
cohesive framework.

6.1 Building on Existing Standards
The proposed architecture aligns with and extends current protocol
development:

• L8 (Agent Communication Layer): The foundational
capabilities of L8 are already substantially implemented in
existing protocols:

– Message Structure: A2A [1] and MCP [5] provide
well-defined message envelopes with sender, receiver,
message IDs, and structured content (tasks, artifacts,
tool invocations).

– Performatives: A2A’s task-oriented operations (task
requests, artifact exchanges, status updates) map nat-
urally to speech acts. MCP’s tool invocation model
similarly expresses intent.

– Interaction Patterns: While A2A currently imple-
ments client-server patterns, SLIM [10] extends this
with publish-subscribe, group communication, and
streaming RPC (SRPC) over secure channels. SLIM’s
MLS-based end-to-end encryption and hierarchical
naming provide the security and routing foundation
for diverse interaction patterns.

– Extension Mechanisms: A2A’s extension framework
provides a pathway to incorporate additional interac-
tion patterns and semantic capabilities directly into
the protocol.

The L8 standardization effort should focus on unifying these
capabilities into a consistent framework, rather than creat-
ing entirely new protocols.

• L9 (Semantic Layer): This layer represents the novel con-
tribution, as no current protocol provides semantic negotia-
tion capabilities. However, the implementation can leverage
existing technologies:

– Formal Schemas (for Grounding): JSON Schema
and Protocol Buffers—already used
