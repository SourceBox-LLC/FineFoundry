able, intentions are clear, and
interaction roles are well-defined.

To achieve this, L8 provides three essential components:

(1) Message Structure (The Envelope): Defines the standard
"envelope" for all agent messages, ensuring messages are
parseable and routable. Protocols like A2A [1] and MCP [5]
implement this through structured messages, tasks, and
artifacts that specify sender, receiver(s), message ID, and
performative. This provides the syntactic foundation for
reliable message exchange.

(2) Performatives (The Speech Act): Standardizes the com-
municative intent of messages, separate from their content.
This ensures agents understand what action is being re-
quested or performed, regardless of the semantic payload.
A2A’s message structure naturally supports this through its
task-oriented design, where operations like task requests,
artifact exchanges, and status updates represent distinct
speech acts. More generally, we identify that the registry
of standardized speech acts includes:

• Transactional: ‘REQUEST‘, ‘AGREE‘, ‘REFUSE‘, ‘IN-

FORM‘

• Negotiation: ‘PROPOSE‘, ‘ACCEPT‘, ‘REJECT‘,

‘COUNTER_PROPOSE‘

• Information: ‘QUERY‘, ‘SUBSCRIBE‘, ‘PUBLISH‘

(3) Interaction Patterns (The Dance): Formalizes the ex-
pected sequence and coordination of messages, ensuring
agents understand their role in multi-step interactions. While
A2A currently implements client-server patterns, protocols
like SLIM (Secure Low-Latency Interactive Messaging) [10]

Charles Fleming, Vijoy Pandey, Luca Muscariello, and Ramana Kompella

extend this with publish-subscribe and group communica-
tion capabilities. Combined, these protocols can support:
• Request-Reply: A simple 1:1 ‘REQUEST‘ followed by

an ‘AGREE‘ or ‘REFUSE‘.

• Publish-Subscribe: A 1:N pattern where agents ‘SUB-
SCRIBE‘ to a topic and receive ‘INFORM‘ messages.
• Aggregation: An N:1 pattern where a leader agent
requests data from a population, which is then aggre-
gated.

• Collaboration Groups: N:N patterns where multi-
ple agents coordinate in secure groups, exchanging
artifacts and coordinating tasks distributedly.

A2A’s extension mechanism provides a pathway for incor-
porating these interaction patterns directly into the proto-
col layer.

Together, these components ensure that agents can parse mes-
sages (structure), understand what is being requested (intent), and
coordinate their role in the interaction (patterns)—all without re-
quiring shared semantic understanding. This syntactic and protocol
foundation is what separates L8 from L9: L8 provides the “how”
of communication, while L9 (described next) provides the “what.”
Only by combining both layers can agents achieve truly reliable,
scalable collaboration.

4.2 Layer 9: The Agent Semantic Negotiation

Layer (SNL)

Above L8 sits the Agent Semantic Negotiation Layer (L9). This
layer’s sole responsibility is to establish a verifiable, shared meaning
for the ‘content‘ payload of L8 messages. It acts as a specialized
mediator that ensures semantic alignment before the primary task
is ever processed.

Unlike L8, where protocols like A2A [1], MCP [5], and SLIM [10]
provide substantial capabilities for message structure and inter-
action patterns, L9 represents a capability that does not exist in
current agent communication protocols. While FIPA-ACL [3] ac-
knowledged the need for shared ontologies through its ‘:ontology‘
parameter, no protocol provides mechanisms for discovering, nego-
tiating, and locking semantic contexts at the protocol level. Agents
today must rely on application-level conventions or expensive, non-
deterministic natural language negotiation.

L9 draws inspiration from distributed computing, where pro-
cesses coordinate through shared memory or signaling mecha-
nisms [2]. Just as distributed algorithms use shared state (mutexes,
semaphores, message queues) to coordinate concurrent processes,
multi-agent systems require shared semantic contexts to coordinate
autonomous agents. The difference is profound: distributed pro-
cesses share data structures; distributed agents
