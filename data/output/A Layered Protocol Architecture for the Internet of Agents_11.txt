 creat-
ing entirely new protocols.

• L9 (Semantic Layer): This layer represents the novel con-
tribution, as no current protocol provides semantic negotia-
tion capabilities. However, the implementation can leverage
existing technologies:

– Formal Schemas (for Grounding): JSON Schema
and Protocol Buffers—already used by A2A, MCP, and
SLIM—are ideal for defining the structure of semantic
concepts and tasks. The L9 SNL would validate mes-
sage content against these schemas within negotiated
contexts.

– Lightweight Ontologies (for Meaning): To define
relationships between concepts (e.g., "a ‘bookFlight‘
task requires a ‘date‘ parameter"), systems like RDF/OWL
or simpler graph-based models could build Shared Con-
texts. These would be distributed via the same infras-
tructure used for protocol specifications.

– Vectorial Representations (for Nuance): For inher-
ently ambiguous concepts (e.g., "a stylish hotel"), L9
Shared Contexts could include embedding fields. The
SNL-HELLO handshake would negotiate embedding
models (e.g., ‘text-embedding-3-small‘), allowing se-
mantic similarity comparisons.

– Security Integration: L9’s semantic validation would
operate above SLIM’s MLS encryption layer, ensur-
ing that cryptographically secure messages also carry
semantically valid content.

6.2 Implementation Strategy
A pragmatic path forward involves:

(1) Extend A2A with L9 Capabilities: A2A’s extension mech-
anism could incorporate SNL handshake messages (SNL-
HELLO, SNL-SELECT, SNL-LOCK) as a standardized ex-
tension, enabling semantic negotiation while maintaining
backward compatibility.

(2) Integrate SLIM for L8 Interaction Patterns: SLIM’s
publish-subscribe and streaming RPC provide the missing
interaction patterns for L8. Agents using A2A for trans-
actional operations could leverage SLIM for coordinative
patterns.

(3) Prototype L9 SNL: Develop reference implementations of
the Semantic Negotiation Layer as libraries that work with

Charles Fleming, Vijoy Pandey, Luca Muscariello, and Ramana Kompella

existing protocols, demonstrating semantic validation, con-
text negotiation, and integration with LLM-based agents.
(4) Establish Schema Authority Pilot: Create a pilot SA for
a specific domain (e.g., travel, supply chain) to demonstrate
context signing, distribution, and versioning.

6.3 Remaining Challenges
Despite leveraging existing standards, significant challenges re-
main:

• Performance Overhead: The semantic handshake intro-
duces latency. This must be amortized by using persistent
"semantic sessions" that survive across multiple L8 message
exchanges.

• The Bootstrapping Problem: How is the initial registry
of Shared Contexts created? This requires cross-industry
standardization efforts, similar to how schema.org emerged
for web content. Early domain-specific pilots are essential.
• Representation Alignment: If two agents use different
embedding models, their vector spaces will not align. This
remains an open research problem [11]. The SNL provides
the protocol to negotiate this, but the underlying ML tech-
niques must advance.

• Prompt Injection Defense: As noted in the security sec-
tion, detecting semantic injection in validated fields is an
unsolved problem. Semantic firewalls must focus on autho-
rization and rate limiting until better content inspection
techniques emerge.

7 Conclusion
Network architecture has historically evolved to meet new demands:
from packet delivery (IP) to reliable sessions (TCP) to structured
application communication (HTTP/2/3). As autonomous agents
become significant network actors, the protocol stack may require
corresponding evolution to support their coordination needs.

This paper proposes a two-layer extension building on existing
work. The Agent Communication Layer (L8) formalizes struc-
tural capabilities emerging in A2A [1], MCP [5], and SLIM [10],
standardizing message envelopes, task delegation, and interaction
patterns. The Agent Semantic Negotiation Layer (L9) introduces
protocol-level semantic negotiation—enabling agents to discover,
negotiate, and lock formal contexts defining concepts and param-
eters. This addresses a capability gap in current protocols, where
