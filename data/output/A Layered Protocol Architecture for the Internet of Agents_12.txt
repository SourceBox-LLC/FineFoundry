standardizing message envelopes, task delegation, and interaction
patterns. The Agent Semantic Negotiation Layer (L9) introduces
protocol-level semantic negotiation—enabling agents to discover,
negotiate, and lock formal contexts defining concepts and param-
eters. This addresses a capability gap in current protocols, where
semantic alignment occurs informally at the application layer.

Separating syntactic structure (L8) from semantic meaning (L9)
supports both transactional patterns (agent orchestration) and coor-
dinative patterns (agent collaboration). Challenges remain: seman-
tic handshake latency, context registry standardization, semantic
injection defense, and governance models for Schema Authori-
ties. However, multi-agent systems are already deployed in supply
chains, distributed systems, and collaborative reasoning. Building
on existing protocols while adding formal semantic negotiation
could provide improved interoperability and reliability for these
emerging applications.
