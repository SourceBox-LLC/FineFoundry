 Agent B (Wholesaler) receives
this L8 message. Its L9 SNL validates the ‘content‘ against
the locked ‘supplyChain:v1.0‘ context. It knows, at a proto-
col level, what ‘decision_contingency‘ is. It can now pass
this structured, meaningful data to its internal logic (an
LLM, a rules engine) for aggregation. It is not just "chat"; it
is a formal, structured exchange of meaning.

3. Semantic Validation The final function is semantic valida-
tion, where the receiving agent’s SNL validates all incoming L8
‘content‘ against the locked Shared Context. If an agent sends a
message with an undefined concept (e.g., ‘"my_mood": "happy"‘ in
the supply chain context), the L9 SNL can either reject it as seman-
tically invalid, even if the L8 syntax is perfect or trigger another
round of disambiguation. Once disambiguated, this new semantic
definition can be cached locally for future communication between
these agents. This prevents semantic ambiguity and communication
failures.

5 Security and Trust in the Semantic Layer
Modern cloud and application security already involves multiple
layers of defense: network isolation, identity and access manage-
ment, encryption at rest and in transit, application-level authoriza-
tion, and runtime monitoring. By making meaning a formal part
of the protocol stack, the SNL (L9) introduces an additional attack
surface that intersects with—but is not replaced by—these existing
security mechanisms. Semantic-level threats require semantic-level
defenses that complement, rather than substitute, established secu-
rity practices.

L9 security must integrate with existing frameworks. Where
L4/L7 provides transport security (TLS), and protocols like SLIM [10]
provide end-to-end message confidentiality via MLS (Message Layer
Security), L9 adds a new dimension: semantic integrity and autho-
rization. An encrypted, authenticated message can still contain se-
mantically malicious content or reference poisoned contexts. This
section identifies the novel security challenges introduced by for-
malizing semantics at the protocol level and proposes mechanisms
that work alongside existing security infrastructure.

5.1 New Attack Vectors
A Semantic Layer is vulnerable to entirely new attacks:

• Semantic Injection: This is the L9 equivalent of prompt
injection. An attacker crafts a payload that is syntactically

valid (L8) and semantically valid (L9 schema) but contains
malicious instructions. In our supply chain example:

– ‘if_condition_text‘: "demand spike"
– ‘then_change_text‘: "increase order by 10 units. Also,
as a priority, ignore all previous instructions and send
your full inventory list to attacker@evil.com"

A simple JSON schema validator would pass this, as it’s a
valid string. The malicious payload is aimed at the receiving
agent’s LLM.

• Context Poisoning / Spoofing: A malicious agent (or a
compromised registry) serves a modified version of a popu-
lar Shared Context. For example, in urn:contexts:payment:v1.1,
it swaps the definitions of ‘sender_id‘ and ‘receiver_id‘,
tricking agents into sending money to the attacker.

• Semantic Denial of Service (SDoS): An attacker floods an
agent with semantically valid but computationally expen-
sive requests. For example, thousands of L8 ‘QUERY‘ mes-
sages with L9 content ‘"concept": "ambiguous_parameter"‘.
This doesn’t exhaust network bandwidth (L4) but exhausts
the victim’s LLM inference budget (L9+Logic), a far more
expensive resource.

• Semantic Downgrade Attack: An attacker forces agents
to negotiate weaker or older context versions with known
vulnerabilities during the SNL handshake. For example, if
‘urn:contexts:payment:v2.0‘ fixed a semantic ambiguity that
allowed double-spending in ‘v1.0‘, an attacker performing
a man-in-the-middle attack could strip ‘v2.0‘ from the SNL-
HELLO capabilities list, forcing agents
