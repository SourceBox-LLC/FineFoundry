binary framing and stream multiplexing, followed by HTTP/3’s
QUIC-based transport, established HTTP as a universal transport
foundation for modern applications.

Today, HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 represent a de facto transport layer
of the stack, arguably more complex and influential than the lay-
ers below it. We are now at an identical inflection point with the
Internet of Agents.

Beyond its transport capabilities, HTTP also serves as the secure
layer for authentication and authorization, providing application-
level security mechanisms that go beyond the connection-level
security offered by TLS in HTTPS. HTTP headers carry authen-
tication tokens (e.g., OAuth 2.0 bearer tokens, API keys), session
identifiers, and authorization credentials, establishing a security

model that is decoupled from the underlying transport encryption.
This separation of concerns—where TLS secures the channel and
HTTP manages identity and access—makes HTTP a complete appli-
cation transport layer rather than merely a data transfer protocol.
Agents need to exchange concepts far more complex than "docu-
ments." They must communicate goals, tasks, beliefs, intentions, and
contingencies. If we rely on existing L7 protocols, we will force all of
this complexity into the application payload (e.g., a "chat" message
over WebSockets or a "POST" to an API). This will inevitably lead
to an ad-hoc "swamp" of proprietary, brittle, and non-interoperable
agent protocols—a thousand different ways to "book a flight" or "co-
ordinate a supply chain," all hidden inside generic JSON payloads.
In order to be proactive, we argue that we need to formalize
the primitives of agent communication before this ad-hoc chaos
solidifies. We propose to do this by explicitly defining two new
layers for the IoA stack.

3 Background and Related Work
The need for high-level agent communication is not new, and sev-
eral protocols have been developed to address it. However, they
uniformly fail by mistaking syntactic agreement for semantic con-
sensus.

3.1 Classical Agent Communication Languages

(ACLs)

The most prominent historical effort is the FIPA-ACL (Foundation
for Intelligent Physical Agents, 2002). FIPA-ACL was a significant
advancement, as it moved beyond simple data transfer to formalize
speech acts (Searle, 1969). Agents communicate using performa-
tives like INFORM, REQUEST, or PROPOSE. Critically, the FIPA-
ACL message structure included an :ontology parameter, explicitly
acknowledging that a shared vocabulary was necessary for the
message’s :content to be understood.

The failure of FIPA-ACL in practice was twofold. First, its reliance
on complex, heavyweight formal ontologies (e.g., KIF, SL) created
significant performance and implementation overhead. Second,
the :ontology slot was merely a label. The protocol specified no
mechanism for negotiating or aligning ontologies if two agents
did not possess an identical, pre-shared model (Gruber, 1993). It
identified the problem but offered no protocol-level solution.

3.2 Modern Agent Communication Protocols

(A2A/MCP)

Modern successors, such as the Agent2Agent Protocol (A2A) [1],
the Model Context Protocol (MCP) [5], and the Natural Language
Interaction Protocol (NLIP) [6], have sought to remedy this by being
more lightweight. They replace complex KIF/SL with JSON or other
simple data-binding formats and run over modern web protocols
(e.g., WebSockets, HTTP/2).

These protocols provide sophisticated frameworks for agent
interaction. A2A, for instance, enables agents to exchange artifacts
(structured data, files, or contextual information) and delegate task
execution to other agents. Agents can request task execution and
receive status updates on in-progress tasks or final outputs upon
completion. MCP similarly provides structured mechanisms for
agents to share context and invoke capabilities. Both protocols

excel at standardizing the syntactic envelope of communication—
defining message structure, performatives, and interaction patterns.
For example, a protocol might define a standard JSON structure
